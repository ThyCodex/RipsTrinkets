To keep it short and simply. This is all the avaible versions of Rip's Trinkets. You can find the most current version here but also at https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/rips-trinkets/

please leave comments for any questions. just so you are aware if you change versions of minecraft these packs are meant for 1.20.5 - 1.21 and with that said you can down grade if need be as
well as upgrade. As for minecraft versions 1.20.4 and lower, this will now work for those as of yet. But later plans are to add 1.18.2 - 1.20.4 as well. But that is not set in stone. Lets see
how well this turns out before then.
